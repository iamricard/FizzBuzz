Haven't posed a community problem lately, so here goes.

The so-called "fizzbuzz" problem is commonly posed to prospective job candidates
in programming/CS/software engineering type positions. Can you solve it?

### RULES
Be honest; don't cheat with google. It takes the fun out of problem solving.
Use ANY programming language you want. It can be solved in many ways using many
different languages.
Post your source code and program output so I can verify that it actually works.
Either use code tags, Pastebin, or upload it in an archive (e.g. .zip)

### INSTRUCTIONS

Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for every
number that is a multiple of 3 print "Fizz" instead. For every number that is
a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead. Finally, for every number that is
a multiple of BOTH 3 and 5, print out "FizzBuzz".
